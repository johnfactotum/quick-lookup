## FAQ

### Why does it only support English Wiktionary?

This app only supports the [English version](https://en.wiktionary.org/) of [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/). This means that you can lookup all words of all languages and find their definitions and descriptions in English.

This is because Wiktionary's definition API is currently only available for English. Explanation from [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Wiktionary_definition_popups_in_the_Android_Wikipedia_app):

> Wiktionary content is unstructured, and presenting a concise set of definitions requires parsing them from the page HTML. English Wiktionary has an entry layout guide which assisted in this for the current English-only implementation. 

### Why is WebKit a dependency?

Because I'm lazy and I used the DOM APIs provided by WebKit to manipulate HTML markups.

### Will you add support for other online/offline dictionaries?

Probably not, because I'm lazy.
